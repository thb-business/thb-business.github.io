    <h2>Welcome to Year 7 Press</h2>
    <p class="byline">By Hammad Abdullah · 17th September 2025 at 4:17pm.</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Year 7 Press</strong> — our very own student newspaper. Unlike the first days of school when everything felt new, this time we’re stepping forward with experience, confidence, and ideas shaped by the time we’ve already spent in these halls.</p>

    <p>We’ve seen how others have made things, but this? This is by a student, for students (and adults too if they want i guess)  The <em>Press</em> is our space to share stories that matter to us: from school highlights to creative art, from animations to thought-provoking news.</p>

    <p>This newspaper is proof that Year 7 students aren’t just the “younger ones” of the school. We’re contributors, creators, and voices with something to say. With our knowledge of the school community and our fresh energy, we aim to make <strong>Year 7 Press</strong> both inspiring and fun to read.</p>

    <p> This is not just a newspaper — it’s a platform built by students, for students, with the spirit of code but the creativity of Year 7.</p>
